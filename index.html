	<h3> Arc de Triomphe</h3>
	<p> The Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile is one of the most famous monuments in Paris, France, <br>standing at the western end of the Champs-Élysées at the centre of Place Charles de Gaulle, <br> formerly named Place de l'Étoile—the étoile or "star" of the juncture formed by its twelve radiating avenues.<br> The location of the arc and the plaza is shared between three arrondissements, 16th (south and west),<br> 17th (north), and 8th (east). The Arc de Triomphe honours those who fought and died for France in <br> the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, with the names of all French victories and generals <br>inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I.</p>
